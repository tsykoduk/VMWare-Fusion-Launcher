**VMWare Fusion Launcher for OSX**

A fully command line VMWare Fusion manager program, allowing the user to 

* starts headless and headed VM's
* stops VM's
* restarts VM's
* lists running VM's
* Lists, Adds, Deletes and Reverts to Snapshot

from the command line. Great for remote dev boxes, or command line junkies.

Tested to run on: 10.6.4 running Ruby 1.9.2dev via rvm and mac's system ruby.

**Usage:**

Execute start, and follow along the cool menus.


If you get a "file already in use" error, try turning off the native OSX app for Fusion
